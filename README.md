# Blindness_Detection

This project is a ongoing challange on <b>Kaggle</b> where we have to develope a strategy to design a system which will be able to detet the category of blindness in the human eye.
<br>
According to the dataset, there are following categories such as :

    0 - NO DR
    1 - MILD
    2 - MODERATE
    3 - SEVERE
    4 - PORIFERATIVE DR

Directory Structure of the dataset ( Size 10GB ):
        
    sample_submission.csv
    test.csv
    train.csv
    train.csv
    test_images.zip

For this project i will be using the <b>Google Colab</b> because this kind of heavy image dataset requires a lot powerful device and google colab free storage for <b>GPU </b> or <b> TPU </b> based runtime environment and <b> python</b will be my primary language.

The next few steps will guide the user to how to setup the environment and  how to download the dataset.

Please follow the exact steps:

//To install kaggle packeges and related python packages.

        ! pip install kaggle torchvision torch pandas matplotlib numpy scipy scikit-learn
